\section{Motivation}
Fancy screenshots of other (almost) realtime solutions.
Games, Simulations, Movies, bla bla bla bla.
BLABLABLABLABLABLA.
In some way this paragraph is a compressed version of previous work and theory.

\section{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item Realtime global illumination, first bounce
\subitem Dynamic camera, scene and lights!
\item No significant precomputation
\subitem This is important, as it excludes LightSkin!
\item Support both diffuse and glossy reflections
\subitem Simple BRDFs are okay, but we want to parameterize them 
\item Temporal consistency
\item Preferable scalable with large scenes
\item Adequate lighting quality
\item Colored indirect shadows
\subitem Obviously I need to make a heavy trade-off here
\end{itemize}

\section{Overview}
This paragraph is a compressed version of the main part

It is super easy. We just do that. We're done. And it is awesome!

\section{Thesis Outline}
META TALK!!!!!!!!1111!!!!

First we will tell you how this specific science works. Then we will convince you that science was done by others. Then we will show you that we also did some science. After that we will punch science in your face, using graphs and tables. And finally we will conclude about the same thing we wrote here in the first place.
