\section{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item Realtime global illumination, first bounce
\subitem Dynamic camera, scene and lights!
\item No significant precomputation
\subitem This is important, as it excludes LightSkin!
\item Support both diffuse and glossy reflections
\subitem Simple BRDFs are okay, but we want to parameterize them 
\item Temporal consistency
\item Preferable scalable with large scenes
\item Adequate lighting quality
\item Colored indirect shadows
\subitem Obviously I need to make a heavy trade-off here
\end{itemize}
