\section{Theoretical Foundation}
We're doing science, so we need to know stuff prior to knowing stuff!

\subsection{Photometric Quantities}
L,I,E, the whole zoo

\subsection{Rendering Equation}
Oh it is sooooo claaaaaaaaaaassy :D

\subsection{Heckbert Notation}
LSD...E! *\_*

\subsection{Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function}
Complicated but Blinn-Phong!

\section{(Hemi-)Spherical Basis Functions}
\subsection{Spherical Basis Functions}
\subsubsection{Spherical Harmonics}
\subsubsection{Wavelets}

\subsection{Hemi Spherical Basis Functions}
\subsubsection{Hemi-Spherical Harmonics}
\subsubsection{H Basis}
\subsubsection{HL2 Basis}

\section{Modern GPU Pipeline and Capabilities}
They are so fast, we can solve the rendering equation directly. ... wait


\section{Realtime Rendering}
Super awesome book about EVERYTHING! \cite{bib:RealtimeRenderingBook} (Tomas Akenine-M\"{o}ller and Eric Haines and Natty Hoffman).

\subsection{Shadow Mapping}
Boooooooooooooring!

\subsection{Deferred Rendering}
Mention more advanced techniques like tiled/clustered forward/deferred shading.
