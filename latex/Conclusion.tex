Solid Voxelization: "Fast Parallel Surface and Solid Voxelization on GPUs"  Schwarz \& Seidel 


* something temporal? accumulating information?
* Alter lookup lookup direction for caches to improve specular sampling
  * Similar to SH gradients
  * It should somehow be possible to...
* "supergrid" shares certain values between caches
* better fill hole: dilate on lowest (or all?) level intead of pull/push like approach ?
* only relevant parts on specular envmap
* Jitter cache grid
  * tried shortly, but looked like a bad idea
* different projection for specenvmap
* do chroma downsampling as in \cite{bib:radiancecachechromaticcompression}
