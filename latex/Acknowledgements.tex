\label{chap:Acknowledgments}

I would like to especially thank my supervisor and good friend Johannes whose support was far beyond what I would expect from any supervisor.
Special thanks to Anke who cheered me up when I got stuck badly, discussed contents even if she had other things to do and reviewed the thesis.
I look forward to return you the favor!
\\
Further, I would like to thank John for his extensive proofreading.
Thanks to Prof. Grosch who made this thesis possible and laid out the basic direction.
As well to Dr. RÃ¶ssl who took the role of the second examiner without any hesitation.

Since this thesis also marks the end of my time as a student in Magdeburg, I want to thank all the people who helped me on my way through the bachelor and master.
In this context my deep gratitude goes to my parents who supported me every single step of the way I have taken since I left our family home.
\\
I was lucky to find many friends during my studies who made me feel home.
It will be very hard to leave you behind!
\\
Special thanks also to all the people who worked with me at Acagamics.
While it may look like I was teaching others in the lectures I gave, you cannot imagine how many things I learned from you all.
\\
Last but not least I want to thank all the extremely supportive professors and the university staff for making my education possible in the first place.
