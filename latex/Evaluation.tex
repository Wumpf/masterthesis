\chapter{Evaluation}
This chapter will evaluate the proposed algorithms both from a performance and a quality perspective. Since PC and mobile algorithms are very different, they will be examined separately.

\section{Implementation Details}
Deferred Renderer, 32bits per Layer RGB(A) srgb - Diffuse, RG 16snorm - Normals with angles, extra infos todo, R32F Depth Buffer (swapped near/far)
