\chapter{Evaluation}\label{chap:eva}
This chapter will evaluate the proposed algorithms both from a performance and a quality perspective.
In the last section we try to compare our technique to related works.
However, as we were not able to implement comparable implementations within the bounds of this project, we can only provide comparisons on an abstract level.

\section{Test Setup \& Scenes} \label{sec:eva:setup}
All tests were rendered using a Nvidia GTX670 desktop graphics card.
The test machine contains a Intel i7-3770 CPU and uses Windows 8 64bit as OS.

\end{figure}
\autoref{fig:testscenes} gives an overview over the main test scenes used in this chapter (and throughout the thesis).
We use McGuire's \cite{bib:McGuire2011Data} version of the well known Crytek \dataset{Sponza} scene which was modeled by Frank Meinl.
For a better fit into our physically based pipeline we used the freely provided texture set  by Alexandre Pestana \cite{bib:sponzapbr}.
Additionally, we placed a continuously rotating Utah teapot with a custom metal-like texture in the scene to show-case specular reflections on a curved surface with varying metallic and roughness values.
\\
The \dataset{Sibenik} cathedral scene is as well from McGuire's database \cite{bib:McGuire2011Data}.
To fill the empty space, we added a dinosaur skeleton from the "Natural History Museeum" modelled by Alvara Luna Bautista and Joel Anderson (available at \url{http://www.3drender.com/challenges/}).
\\
The \dataset{Republique} scene was extracted from a Unity3D tech demo for the game "RÃ©publique Remastered" by Camouflaj.
The entire demo is freely available on the Unity Assetstore \cite{bib:republique}.

\section{Parameter Overview}
How our approach performs depends on several parameters.
To make this chapter more readable and make comparisons easier, we introduce a standard configuration on all parameters.
If not noted otherwise we fall back to these default settings.
The defaults are annotated in brackets in the following parameter overview:
\begin{easylist}
\ListProperties(Hide=100, Hang=true, Progressive=4ex, Space=0.0ex, Space3=-0.5ex, Space*=-0.5ex, Style*=$\bullet\,$,
Style2*=\textbf{--} ,Style3*=$\circ$ ,Style4*=\tiny$\blacksquare$ )
# general
## number of active caches
### cache address volume resolution ($32^3$)
### cascading settings (4 cascades, last cascade covers always entire scene)
### camera
## reflective shadow map resolution (rendering $1024^2$, indirect light $64^2$)
## screen resolution ($1920\times1080$)
## number of SH bands for diffuse lighting (2 bands)
## number of lights (a single spot light)
# shadowing
## shadow lod (2)
## voxel resolution ($128^3$)
# specular
## specular environment map resolution ($16^2$)
## direct write or cached write (direct write)
\end{easylist}
This chapter tries to give insights on their effects.
We limit our observation to meaningful ranges and do not experiment with arbitrary combinations.

\section{Performance}
The performance and scalability of our approach is examined in this section.
To be able to evaluate how specific parts of our algorithm perform, we use multi-buffered OpenGL timer queries to check how long a series of calls take to finish on the GPU (\texttt{GL\_TIME\_ELAPSED}) without stalling it.
The sum of timings from multiple commands may exceed the total time a frame takes since the GPU might work on multiple commands at a time.
However, in our tests this overlap seems to play a minor role since most tasks are either very computational intense or are depending on each other which prohibits parallel command execution.
\\
In general such measurements can slow down the rendering process.
For our scenarios though, we did not measure any drops in the independently measured framerate with activated timer queries.

\subsection{General Breakdown}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{eva/breakdown/specoff.pdf}
\caption{Timing breakdown with a moving camera (for 30s) for indirect diffuse lighting. x: frame index, y: stacked duration.}
\label{fig:frameratebreakdown:specoff}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{eva/breakdown/specon.pdf}
\caption{Timings with a moving camera  (for 30s) for indirect diffuse \& \emph{specular} lighting. x: frame index, y: stacked duration.}
\label{fig:frameratebreakdown:specon}
\end{figure}

First, we want to provide a general overview over how long the different steps of our rendering pipeline usually take.
For this, we measure all timings along 30 seconds camera flights through our test scenes using the default settings mentioned in \autoref{sec:eva:setup}.
These paths are shown by the accompanying videos. \todo{MAKE THESE VIDEOS}
The first set of graphs in \autoref{fig:frameratebreakdown:specoff} shows timings without and the second in \autoref{fig:frameratebreakdown:specoff} with indirect specular reflections.
The stacked area plots are sorted in the order in which the respective passes are issued, starting with the G-buffer creation (light green) at the bottom and ending with the cache interpolation on top (beige).
The black line at the top of all plots shows the total duration for each recorded frame.
Note that there is a small white gap bellow this line which represents the duration of all overheads that were not measured explicitly like tonemapping, several uniform buffer updates and output to the backbuffer.

As easily can be seen, the indirect specular lighting increases the costs of the indirect lighting pass (dark yellow) considerably while the additional mipmapping of the specular environment map is very cheap.
Since the light does not move in these tests, the rendering of the reflective shadow map (dark grey) is constant over time.
The duration of the voxelization pass and its blending + mipmapping is constant as well since there are no changes in resolution, number of written cells or geometrical complexity of the scene.
More surprisingly, there are also almost no changes over time in the cache allocation pass (bright yellow) even when the cache lighting pass (dark yellow) is significantly slower which hints a higher number of light caches.
Since the main influence to this and the other two cache related passes is the number of of active caches we will investigate this further in the next section on cache count. 
The strong changes in the duration of the G-buffer creation pass (especially in \dataset{Sponza}) stem from varying depending on the current view orientation.

In general, the performance in the three scenes does not differ much.
Only the significantly more complex \dataset{Republique} scene performs a bit slower which is observable especially without indirect specular.

\subsection{Cache Count}
Retrieving the current cache count from the GPU is a very costly operation unless extensive multi-buffering is used to avoid stalls (i.e. keeping the count in a different buffer every frame to ensure to perform reads only on an unused one).
Therefore, we measured the cache count over time separately and combined the results in the graphs seen in \autoref{fig:cachecountovertime}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{eva/cachecountovertime/combined.pdf}
\caption{Visualization of the influence of cache count (black) to all relevant passes over time (30s), using the same camera flights and settings as in \autoref{fig:frameratebreakdown:specoff}.}
\label{fig:cachecountovertime}
\end{figure}
Surprisingly, there seems to be only slight correlation between the duration of the cache lighting pass and the number of caches.
The duration of the allocate pass is rather stable over time and only the apply cache pass shows a slight and very unsteady correlation to the cache count.
The steadiness of the cache allocation pass comes most likely from the fact that on average every thread group performs a single cache allocation attempt regardless of the cache count.
Weather an attempt is redundant or not might not as important for the runtime.
The cache apply pass on the other hand has a strict control flow, i.e. it executes the same code insensitive to the number of caches.
This leaves only the changing number of cache misses as reasonable explanation for its behavior.
Clearly, the main bottleneck of the cache lighting pass in the preceding tests is not the raw number of caches to be lit, but another factor that changed along the tested camera paths.
To reduce the number of influences we ran the same experiment in the \dataset{Sponza} scene again with disabled indirect shadow.
\\
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{eva/cachecountovertime/sponza_noshadow.pdf}
\caption{Cache count (black) in comparison to indirect lighting passes with inactive indirect shadowing (camera path and other settings as in \autoref{fig:frameratebreakdown:specoff}).}
\label{fig:cachecountovertime:noshadow}
\end{figure}
The results, seen in \autoref{fig:cachecountovertime:noshadow}, show a even more extreme picture:
Now the duration of the caching pass is almost completely constant, while correlations of the cache count and the performance of the other two parts are much better visible.
Naturally we suspected a bug in the implementation of the light caching pass that is expected to a have linear performance characteristic in respect to the number of active light caches.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{eva/cachecount.pdf}
\caption{Performance for different cache counts. Recorded in \dataset{Sponza} with varying CAV resolutions, starting with $16^3$, ending with $192^3$. Otherwise default settings without indirect specular. }
\label{fig:cachecountdirect}
\end{figure}
However, more experiments with higher cache counts show that there is in fact such a linear correlation.
This time we chose a fixed view point in the \dataset{Sponza} scene, using the default non-specular settings and measure the performance (and cache count) for different CAV resolutions.
The results are plotted in \autoref{fig:cachecountdirect}.
The implementation of the cache lighting pass uses 512 threads per group since it performed best on average with this count.
As the shared memory optimization (see \autoref{sec:impl:details:lighting}) enforces that all threads of a group remain active, this is also the lowest theoretical granularity to which the performance of this pass can react.
Obviously though, due to the characteristics of our graphics card (number of multiprocessors, minimum/maximum parallel thread groups in flight etc.), the measured granularity is much coarser, especially for a low number of thread groups.
More experiments with different thread group sizes would be necessary for a deeper insight into this matter.
\\
This experiment also shows that the allocate pass is more sensible to the cache count than the apply pass for large cache counts.

\caption{Performance of indirect lighting and cache apply passes in ms for different numbers of spherical harmonics bands and CAV resolutions (resulting cache counts in parenthesis) in the \dataset{Sponza} scene. }
\label{tab:shperf}
\end{table}
For diffuse lighting we use either two or three spherical harmonics bands.
Using more bands was considered to complex to implement for the large performance hit with only slight improvement in lighting which we expect from that.
In fact already switching from two to three bands can result in a much costlier cache apply pass, as can be seen in \autoref{tab:shperf}.

\subsection{RSM Resolution}
\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
    \begin{tabular}{r|rrr}
    \toprule
    \multirow{2}{*}{RSM resolution} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{ shadow/specular}\\

    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\caption{Performance of the cache lighting pass in ms for different reflective shadow map resolutions in the \dataset{Republique} scene. All tests used same number shadow cones. }
\label{tab:RSMsizeperf}
\end{table}
The reflective shadow map resolution has a major impact on the duration of the indirect lighting pass which is practically always the slowest step in our rendering process.
\autoref{tab:RSMsizeperf} shows how the it behaves with different RSM resolutions in the \dataset{Republique} scene with a fixed view point from which 3045 caches are activated. %(which is still in the region of almost constant cache count performance-region" in \autoref{fig:cachecountdirect}).
Increasing the size of the reflective shadow map also increases the number of shadow cones per cache.
Since we are only interested in the effects of the RSM resolution we canceled that factor out by increasing the shadow lod so that the number of cones stays the same.
\\
Resolutions beyond $128^2$ are practically not usable from a real-time performance standpoint, regardless if indirect shadows and specular effects are activated or not.
\todo{More analysis? What?}

\subsection{Indirect Shadow}
Comparing the statistics on cache count influence with (see \autoref{fig:cachecountovertime}) and without shadowing (see \autoref{fig:cachecountovertime:noshadow}) we can already deduce that indirect shadowing has a rather high performance impact depending on how long the shadow cones are traced.
More importantly though, is the shadow lod since together with the RSM resolution it determines how many shadow cones are needed for each cache.

\label{tab:shadowlod}
\end{table}
\autoref{tab:shadowlod} shows measurements of the duration of the cache lighting pass depending on shadow lod ans reflective shadow map resolution.
The last entry in each column was rendered with a single large shadow cone. 
Each entry above quadruples the number of shadow cones.

Another important parameter is the resolution of the voxel volume.
For simplicity, the application only supports cubic volumes that are aligned to the entire scene.
This results in rather poor voxel space usage as all our scenes have a larger extent on a single dominant axis.

\caption{Performance of the cache lighting pass in ms for different shadow lods and voxel volume resolutions in the \dataset{Republique} scene. RSM resolution was fixed to $64^2$.}
\label{tab:shadowvoxelres}
\end{table}
\autoref{tab:shadowvoxelres} shows how the resolution of the voxel volume influences the duration of the cache lighting pass.
For unrealistic high shadow lods there is almost now difference in performance for different voxel resolutions.
This can easily be explained by the fact that a high shadow lod results in large cones that take only few samples in high order mip-levels, thus using a low resolution version of the voxelization anyways.
We deliberately did not include how long the voxelization takes as this was discussed in the works from which our implementation is derived.

\label{tab:specularperf}
\end{table}

So far we have ignored the effect of indirect specular lighting, except in the breakdown overview in \autoref{fig:frameratebreakdown:specon}.
Indirect specular lighting in general has a severe impact on the performance.
\\
As noted in \autoref{sec:impl:details:specular} there are two ways to handle writes to the specular environment map:
Either by writing directly into it or by caching the map in the shader's registers.
\autoref{tab:specularperf} shows timings of the indirect lighting pass in the \dataset{Sponza} scene with varying RSM and specular environment map resolutions for both direct and cached write.
The RSM resolution determines how often writes to the specular environment map occur.
On our machine specular environment maps with a resolution of $8^2$ and lower are clearly faster.
For $16^2$ it depends and $64^2$ lead to a crash on our machine since the driver was not able to compile the shader (which indicates a driver bug since there was no controlled error output).
\\
For direct writes, the performance is very stable independently of the specular environment map resolution.
However, this parameter can raise memory requirements drastically \todo{check and add link to mem req chapter}.

\subsection{Resolution Dependence}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{eva/screen_resolution.pdf}
\caption{Performance of cache allocation and interpolation in ms at different screen resolutions in \dataset{Sibenik} scene. Used CAV with $64^3$, resulting in about 7300 caches.}
\label{fig:resolutionperf}
\end{figure}
Finally we want to test the effect of the screen resolution on our global illumination algorithm.
Both the cache allocation and interpolation (= apply) passes are executed per screen pixel.
As expected, our tests in \autoref{fig:resolutionperf} show an almost linear correlation to the number of screen pixels.
However, especially the duration of the allocate pass increases slowly with the resolution
For this test we used the \dataset{Sibenik} scene and increased the CAV resolution to $64^3$ for a higher cache density.
The exact resulting cache count varies slightly with the different aspect ratio of the resolution configurations.

\section{Quality}
While the previous section examined the effect of several parameters on how well the approach performs in terms of computation time, this section will try to evaluate its general visual quality.
Unlike before, we will do this in a more feature oriented fashion instead of observing the effect of single configuration tweaks. \todo{still true?}

\subsection{Sources of Error}
There are several sources of error in regard to path-traced ground-truth solutions.
As the approach does not claim to be able to compute several phenomenons at all, we limit these observation to the officially supported types of light-paths.
In addition to both specular and diffuse direct lighting, our approach is able to compute specular and diffuse lighting after a diffuse light bounce.
Like in the original reflective shadow mapping, our approach is not able to handle indirect specular light bounces which are necessary to compute caustics.

The reflective shadow map itself is the first source of error.
Problems arise from to its limited resolution which determines how well the scene is sampled.
Low RSM resolutions can lead to flickering during movement and irregular lighting, even with the bias compensation techniques which were discussed in \autoref{sec:fig:rsmbias}.
Also, small features may be missed entirely which leads to either to low or to high brightness in different areas.
\\
The discretized placement of light caches and their later interpolation has a similar effect on the overall accuracy, however in a more temporal stable fashion.
It assumes that there are no features of interest in-between two caches and that the transition can be expressed by simple linear interpolation.
\\
This is especially hazardous in combination with the RSM visibility approximation which is performed by cone-casts in a pre-filtered volume:
The higher the distance between the caches, the higher is their needed start offset since sparsely placed caches lie often deep inside of solid objects.
Voxel cone-casts assume that sampling the density information in arbitrary volume mipmap-levels expresses an isotropic visibility function for any cone going through this sample.
This estimate is more incorrect the more complex the geometry is which was combined into a single opacity value, i.e. it gets worse for higher mip-levels and lower resolutions.
Additionally, as we do not perform solid voxelization, blockers vanish in high mipmap-levels especially for a high starting resolution.
Larger cone angles produce higher errors as they perform samples more often in high mipmap-levels, while tight cones ray-march through (relatively) high-detailed volumes.
Testing multiple VALs at once with a single cone (shadow lod) is based on the assumption that the visibility between arbitrary VALs does not vary much, which is obviously wrong for many cases.
\\
The two ways in which lighting information is saved have each their own accuracy issues.
Since our SH representation (for diffuse lighting) uses only very few bands, it can catch radiance only at very low frequencies.
Using higher SH basis would improve this but leads inevitable to stronger ringing artifacts.
While high frequencies are not necessary to compute irradiance, the representation is far from accurate. \todo{can't find references with numbers. why?}
The specular lighting on the other hand is limited by the per-cache specular environement map resolution that determines practically how large the maximal supported Blinn-Phong exponent is.
Saving only a hemisphere does not introduce any new errors but the hemispherical projection creates some distortion - filtering results on this map is not mathematically correct.
More important, the isotropic filtering process via mipmaps is flawed, as samples on higher mipmap-levels do not represent correct integrals over the anisotropic Blinn-Phong lobes.
However, in practice the largest error originates from the assumption that a single VAL does only affect a single pixel in the specular environment map.
This is more inaccurate with \emph{higher} specular environment and lower RSM resolutions.

\subsection{Indirect Shadow}
\autoref{fig:shadowcomparision:resolutions} shows indirect shadow for different CAV and voxel resolutions.
In \autoref{fig:shadowcomparision:resolutions:cavdensities} the corresponding cache-density is visualized.
For a lower cache density there are sometimes jaggies visible at a shadows border.
Finer details get lost and Peter panning is more likely to occur.
Using multiple cascades, the more distant cascades may have to few caches to represent the shadow at all, as can be seen in the corridor in the upper left of the images.
Higher voxel resolution has not only advantages:
While the shadow borders are more accurate (especially for high CAV resolutions), it is also disproportional brighter and tends to miss distant thin features since the volume is less dense in its higher mipmap-levels.
\\
Similar behavior can be observed for the shadow lod, see \autoref{fig:shadowcomparision:lod}.
With raising shadow lod, the shadow gets brighter and thin features are more likely lost.
Besides, these images also features colored shadows which are an implicit consequence of our technique.
