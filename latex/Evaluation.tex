\chapter{Evaluation}
This chapter will evaluate the proposed algorithms both from a performance and a quality perspective. Since PC and mobile algorithms are very different, they will be examined separately.

\section{Performance}

\subsection{Test Setup}

\newpage

\section{Quality}

\subsection{Artifacts}

regular placement of caches, jaggies,
shadow jaggies,
/interpolation issues

shadow flickering?


\subsection{Temporal Coherency}

Testcase: Republique Atrium\\
32x32 RSM, ShadowLod = 0 flickers!\\
32x32 RSM, ShadowLod = 1 flickers!\\
64x64 RSM, ShadowLod = 1 does NOT flicker!\\
64x64 RSM, ShadowLod = 2 flickers a bit!
