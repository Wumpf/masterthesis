\chapter{Evaluation}\label{chap:eva}
This chapter will evaluate the proposed algorithms both from a performance and a quality perspective. Since PC and mobile algorithms are very different, they will be examined separately.

\section{Performance}

\subsection{Test Setup}

\newpage

\section{Quality}

\subsection{Artifacts}

regular placement of caches, jaggies,
shadow jaggies,
/interpolation issues

shadow flickering?


\subsection{Temporal Coherency}


\section{Comparison to other Techniques} \label{sec:eva:comparisiontoother}

comparison table, similar to the one in radiance hints?

\subsection{Comparison to LightSkin}
