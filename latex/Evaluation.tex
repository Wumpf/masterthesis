\chapter{Evaluation}\label{chap:eva}
This chapter will evaluate the proposed algorithms both from a performance and a quality perspective.
In the last section we try to compare our technique to others.
However, as we were not able to implement comparable implementations within the bounds of this project, we can only provide comparisons on an abstract level.

\section{Test Setup and Parameters}

(TODO)

Parameters:
Cache-Count \& CAV cascading (transition size, cascade distances, cascade count),
RSM Resolution,
Screen Resolution,
Voxel Resolution,
num diffuse SH coefficients

Shadow Lod

Specular:
Resolution, Direct Write



\section{Performance}

\subsection{Indirect Diffuse Only}

\subsection{Indirect Diffuse with Indirect Shadow}

\subsection{Indirect Diffuse \& Specular with Indirect Shadow}

\newpage

\section{Quality}
% phenomelogical: "Quality of light, shadow, etc." - which parameters need to be tweaked

\subsection{Sources of Error and Groundtruth Comparision}

\subsection{Artifacts}
regular placement of caches, jaggies,
shadow jaggies,
/interpolation issues

shadow flickering?

\subsection{Temporal Coherency}

\section{Comparison to other Techniques} \label{sec:eva:comparisiontoother}

comparison table, similar to the one in radiance hints?

\subsection{Comparison to LightSkin}
